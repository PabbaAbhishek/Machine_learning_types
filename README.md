# Machine_learning_types
## This contains sample supervised and unsupervised learning models, for blog readers to better understand the codes behind the models mentioned in the blog.

For the blog readers who read the blog and are curious to know the codes behind the machine learning models, you can go through the two-sample models.

Before running the codes, make sure the following packages are installed on your device.

*  **Pandas**
*  **Scikit-learn**

1) **Supervised learning model**: Logistic regression model and linear regression model are shown here. Download the respective codes and download the respective datasets, ***diabetes*** for logistic regression and ***studentdata*** for linear regression. 
2) **Unsupervised learning model**: Kmeans clustering model is explained. There is no need to download any dataset as scikit-learn's iris dataset is used for the model. Just download the code and see how the model works.
